                Please analyze this data and provide insights on how to make the model perform better.
                Please also provide a recommendation for the next version of the model. The name of the model class should be the same as the name in the model file.
                Please also provide a recommendation for the hyperparameters for the next version of the model.
                Please also provide a recommendation for the architecture for the next version of the model.
                Please also provide a recommendation for the loss function for the next version of the model.
                Please also provide a recommendation for the optimizer for the next version of the model.

                Based on this analysis, please provide an improved version of my model that addresses any issues found in the training patterns.
                The improved model should:
                1. Be a complete, runnable PyTorch Lightning module
                2. Include all necessary imports
                3. Address any overfitting/underfitting issues identified
                4. Optimize the architecture based on the training patterns
                5. Use better hyperparameters if needed

                The name of the model class should be the same as the name in the model file.
